description: "Master index of every skill available on this machine: the active Claude Code skills, all installed SKILL.md files, and the skill repositories saved in the local Repo Vault at http://127.0.0.1:3847/. Use whenever the user asks what skills exist, which skill to use for a task, where a skill lives, how to invoke or install one, or wants to find the right workflow. Also trigger on phrases like is there a skill for this, what can you do, do this properly, or what tools do you have, even if the word skill never appears."

# Skill Library — Master Index

A single lookup table for every skill on this machine. It is a **catalog, not a replacement** for the skills themselves: find the row, then open the referenced `SKILL.md` and follow it. Do not load every file at once.

- **49 unique installed skills** (53 files; 4 duplicates collapsed)
- **14 active built-in / plugin skills** with no local file
- **7 repos in Repo Vault**, exposing **17 additional skill files**

This file lives on the Desktop and is **not installed**; the `Skill` tool will not trigger it. To make it invocable, copy it to `SK\skill-library\SKILL.md`.

**Path shorthands** (expand before using):

| Alias | Full path |
|---|---|
| `SK` | `C:\Users\Hammad Ind\.claude\skills` |
| `PC` | `C:\Users\Hammad Ind\.claude\plugins\cache\anthropic-plugin-directory` |
| `MP` | `C:\Users\Hammad Ind\.claude\plugins\marketplaces\claude-plugins-official` |
| `SP` | `%USERPROFILE%\.claude\plugins\cache\anthropic-plugin-directory\superpowers\6.4.2-8ca22dba9a94\skills` |

## 6. How to choose

1. **Process first.** New work → `brainstorming` → `writing-plans`; bugs → `systematic-debugging`; after changes → `verification-before-completion`.
2. **Then domain.** Match the row's "use when" to the task. Design → `frontend-design` or vault `design`. Security → `security-audit`. Charts → `dataviz`. Harness/config → `update-config`.
3. **Read, don't guess.** Open the referenced file and follow it; this index only routes.
4. **Vault skills need installing** before the `Skill` tool can invoke them.

## 7. Maintenance

Regenerate the inventory when skills change:

```bash
node C:\dev\tools\inventory-skills.mjs C:\dev\tools\skills-inventory.json
node C:\dev\tools\inventory-vault.mjs   C:\dev\tools\vault-inventory.json
```

Duplicates collapsed to one entry: `skill-creator`, `frontend-design`, `claude-md-improver`, `security-audit` each exist in both cache and marketplace (or jobs temp). The canonical paths above are the installed ones.
